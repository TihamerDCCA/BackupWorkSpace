# BackupWorkSpace
My HelloWorld: Back up my laptop to a shared drived with the click of a button

 * A very simple "Hello World" for backing up your files on a shared drive.
 * Future feature: It should really check to see if the file *needs* backing up before actually doing the copy.
 * 
 * It's main feature is that it is simple to use. 
 And unlike all the other file backups all over the web, 
 * it's free and open source.
 * All it needs is a list of directories whose contents you want to copy to the H drive.
 * Just place the BackUpToShare.txt, BackupMaker.cmd, and BackupMaker.jar files 
 * into your home (Documents) directory, edit BackUpToShare.txt to any additional directories.
 * To run it, just double-click on BackupMaker.cmd in your MS File Explorer.
 * (and if you want, add a shortcut to it in your background).
 * 
 * At the end, it tells you how many files it backed up.
